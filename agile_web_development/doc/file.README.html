<p>
Rails is a web-application framework that includes everything needed to
create database-backed web applications according to the Model-View-Control
pattern.
</p>
<p>
This pattern splits the view (also called the presentation) into
&#8220;dumb&#8221; templates that are primarily responsible for inserting
pre-built data in between HTML tags. The model contains the
&#8220;smart&#8221; domain objects (such as Account, Product, Person, Post)
that holds all the business logic and knows how to persist themselves to a
database. The controller handles the incoming requests (such as Save New
Account, Update Product, Show Post) by manipulating the model and directing
data to the view.
</p>
<p>
In Rails, the model is handled by what&#8217;s called an object-relational
mapping layer entitled Active Record. This layer allows you to present the
data from database rows as objects and embellish these data objects with
business logic methods. You can read more about Active Record in <a
href="../files/vendor/rails/activerecord/README.html">files/vendor/rails/activerecord/README.html</a>.
</p>
<p>
The controller and view are handled by the Action Pack, which handles both
layers by its two parts: Action View and Action Controller. These two
layers are bundled in a single package due to their heavy interdependence.
This is unlike the relationship between the Active Record and Action Pack
that is much more separate. Each of these packages can be used
independently outside of Rails. You can read more about Action Pack in <a
href="../files/vendor/rails/actionpack/README.html">files/vendor/rails/actionpack/README.html</a>.
</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<ol>
<li>At the command prompt, start a new Rails application using the
<tt>rails</tt> command and your application name. Ex: rails myapp

</li>
<li>Change directory into myapp and start the web server:
<tt>script/server</tt> (run with --help for options)

</li>
<li>Go to <a href="http://localhost:3000">localhost:3000</a>/ and get
&#8220;Welcome aboard: You&#8217;re riding the Rails!&#8220;

</li>
<li>Follow the guidelines to start developing your application

</li>
</ol>
<h2>Web Servers</h2>
<p>
By default, Rails will try to use Mongrel if it&#8217;s are installed when
started with script/server, otherwise Rails will use WEBrick, the webserver
that ships with Ruby. But you can also use Rails with a variety of other
web servers.
</p>
<p>
Mongrel is a Ruby-based webserver with a C component (which requires
compilation) that is suitable for development and deployment of Rails
applications. If you have Ruby Gems installed, getting up and running with
mongrel is as easy as: <tt>gem install mongrel</tt>. More info at: <a
href="http://mongrel.rubyforge.org">mongrel.rubyforge.org</a>
</p>
<p>
Say other Ruby web servers like Thin and Ebb or regular web servers like
Apache or LiteSpeed or Lighttpd or IIS. The Ruby web servers are run
through Rack and the latter can either be setup to use FCGI or proxy to a
pack of Mongrels/Thin/Ebb servers.
</p>
<h2>Apache .htaccess example for FCGI/CGI</h2>
<p>
# General Apache options AddHandler fastcgi-script .fcgi AddHandler
cgi-script .cgi Options <tt>FollowSymLinks </tt>ExecCGI
</p>
<p>
# If you don&#8217;t want Rails to look in certain directories, # use the
following rewrite rules so that Apache won&#8217;t rewrite certain requests
# # Example: # RewriteCond %<tt>REQUEST_URI</tt> ^/notrails.* # RewriteRule .* -
[L]
</p>
<p>
# Redirect all requests not available on the filesystem to Rails # By
default the cgi dispatcher is used which is very slow # # For better
performance replace the dispatcher with the fastcgi one # # Example: #
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ dispatch.fcgi [QSA,L] RewriteEngine On
</p>
<p>
# If your Rails application is accessed via an Alias directive, # then you
MUST also set the RewriteBase in this htaccess file. # # Example: # Alias
/myrailsapp /path/to/myrailsapp/public # RewriteBase /myrailsapp
</p>
<p>
RewriteRule ^$ index.html [QSA] RewriteRule ^([^.]+)$ $1.html [QSA]
RewriteCond %<tt>REQUEST_FILENAME</tt> !-f RewriteRule ^(.*)$ dispatch.cgi [QSA,L]
</p>
<p>
# In case Rails experiences terminal errors # Instead of displaying this
message you can supply a file here which will be rendered instead # #
Example: # ErrorDocument 500 /500.html
</p>
<p>
ErrorDocument 500 &#8220;<h2>Application error</h2>Rails application failed
to start properly&#8220;
</p>
<h2>Debugging Rails</h2>
<p>
Sometimes your application goes wrong. Fortunately there are a lot of tools
that will help you debug it and get it back on the rails.
</p>
<p>
First area to check is the application log files. Have &#8220;tail
-f&#8221; commands running on the server.log and development.log. Rails
will automatically display debugging and runtime information to these
files. Debugging info will also be shown in the browser on requests from
127.0.0.1.
</p>
<p>
You can also log your own messages directly into the log file from your
code using the Ruby logger class from inside your controllers. Example:
</p>
<pre class="code">
  <span class='kw'>class</span> <span class='const'>WeblogController</span> <span class='op'>&lt;</span> <span class='const'>ActionController</span><span class='op'>::</span><span class='const'>Base</span>
    <span class='kw'>def</span> <span class='id destroy'>destroy</span>
      <span class='ivar'>@weblog</span> <span class='op'>=</span> <span class='const'>Weblog</span><span class='period'>.</span><span class='id find'>find</span><span class='lparen'>(</span><span class='id params'>params</span><span class='lbracket'>[</span><span class='symbol'>:id</span><span class='rbracket'>]</span><span class='rparen'>)</span>
      <span class='ivar'>@weblog</span><span class='period'>.</span><span class='id destroy'>destroy</span>
      <span class='id logger'>logger</span><span class='period'>.</span><span class='id info'>info</span><span class='lparen'>(</span><span class='tstring'><span class='tstring_beg'>&quot;</span><span class='embexpr_beg'>#{</span><span class='const'>Time</span><span class='period'>.</span><span class='id now'>now</span><span class='rbrace'>}</span><span class='tstring_content'> Destroyed Weblog ID #</span><span class='embexpr_beg'>#{</span><span class='ivar'>@weblog</span><span class='period'>.</span><span class='id id'>id</span><span class='rbrace'>}</span><span class='tstring_content'>!</span><span class='tstring_end'>&quot;</span></span><span class='rparen'>)</span>
    <span class='kw'>end</span>
  <span class='kw'>end</span>
</pre>
<p>
The result will be a message in your log file along the lines of:
</p>
<pre class="code">
  Mon Oct 08 14:22:29 +1000 2007 Destroyed Weblog ID #1
</pre>
<p>

These two online (and free) books will bring you up to speed on the Ruby
language and also on programming in general.
</p>
<h2>Debugger</h2>
<p>
Debugger support is available through the debugger command when you start
your Mongrel or Webrick server with --debugger. This means that you
can break out of execution at any point in the code, investigate and change
the model, AND then resume execution! You need to install ruby-debug to run
the server in debugging mode. With gems, use &#8216;gem install
ruby-debug&#8217; Example:
</p>
<pre class="code">
  <span class='kw'>class</span> <span class='const'>WeblogController</span> <span class='op'>&lt;</span> <span class='const'>ActionController</span><span class='op'>::</span><span class='const'>Base</span>
    <span class='kw'>def</span> <span class='id index'>index</span>
      <span class='ivar'>@posts</span> <span class='op'>=</span> <span class='const'>Post</span><span class='period'>.</span><span class='id find'>find</span><span class='lparen'>(</span><span class='symbol'>:all</span><span class='rparen'>)</span>
      <span class='id debugger'>debugger</span>
    <span class='kw'>end</span>
  <span class='kw'>end</span>
</pre>
<p>
So the controller will accept the action, run the first line, then present
you with a IRB prompt in the server window. Here you can do things like:
</p>
<pre class="code">
  &gt;&gt; @posts.inspect
  =&gt; &quot;[#&lt;Post:0x14a6be8 @attributes={\&quot;title\&quot;=&gt;nil, \&quot;body\&quot;=&gt;nil, \&quot;id\&quot;=&gt;\&quot;1\&quot;}&gt;,
       #&lt;Post:0x14a6620 @attributes={\&quot;title\&quot;=&gt;\&quot;Rails you know!\&quot;, \&quot;body\&quot;=&gt;\&quot;Only ten..\&quot;, \&quot;id\&quot;=&gt;\&quot;2\&quot;}&gt;]&quot;
  &gt;&gt; @posts.first.title = &quot;hello from a debugger&quot;
  =&gt; &quot;hello from a debugger&quot;
</pre>
<p>
&#8230;and even better is that you can examine how your runtime objects
actually work:
</p>
<pre class="code">
  &gt;&gt; f = @posts.first
  =&gt; #&lt;Post:0x13630c4 @attributes={&quot;title&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;body&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;id&quot;=&gt;&quot;1&quot;}&gt;
  &gt;&gt; f.
  Display all 152 possibilities? (y or n)
</pre>
<p>
Finally, when you&#8217;re ready to resume execution, you enter
&#8220;cont&#8220;
</p>
<h2>Console</h2>
<p>
You can interact with the domain model by starting the console through
<tt>script/console</tt>. Here you&#8217;ll have all parts of the
application configured, just like it is when the application is running.
You can inspect domain models, change values, and save to the database.
Starting the script without arguments will launch it in the development
environment. Passing an argument will specify a different environment, like
<tt>script/console production</tt>.
</p>
<p>
To reload your controllers and models after launching the console run
<tt>reload!</tt>
</p>
<h2>dbconsole</h2>
<p>
You can go to the command line of your database directly through
<tt>script/dbconsole</tt>. You would be connected to the database with the
credentials defined in database.yml. Starting the script without arguments
will connect you to the development database. Passing an argument will
connect you to a different database, like <tt>script/dbconsole
production</tt>. Currently works for mysql, postgresql and sqlite.
</p>
<h2>Description of Contents</h2>
<p>

<p>
app/controllers
</p>
<pre class="code">
  Holds controllers that should be named like weblogs_controller.rb for
  automated URL mapping. All controllers should descend from ApplicationController
  which itself descends from ActionController::Base.
</pre>

  Holds models that should be named like post.rb.
  Most models will descend from ActiveRecord::Base.
</pre>
<p>
app/views
</p>
<pre class="code">
  Holds the template files for the view that should be named like

  call &lt;% yield %&gt; to render the view using this layout.
</pre>
<p>
app/helpers
